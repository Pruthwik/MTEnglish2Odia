       " 'However, since I had to attend that program some thoughts kept coming iin my mind. ',\n",
       " 'That time, I thought that we call or know those people as handicapped since they are lacking in some ways in terms of their body structure or whose organs do not function properly. ',\n",
       " 'However, at times when we interact with them, we realize that we see only the deficits with our eyes but God has certainly bestowed them with some extra powers. ',\n",

       " 'We think O Great! Look how he works. ',\n",
       " 'So I thought that upon looking at them with our eyes we feel that they are handicapped, but experiences tell us that they have some extra power. ',\n",
       " 'So I thought why not use the term ‘Divyang’ instead of ‘viklang’ in our country. ',\n",

       " 'To make things Sugamya - we need innovation, we need technology, we need systems and we also need empathy from people. ',\n",
       " 'We have taken the initiative. ',\n",
       " 'We are receiving public participation too. ',\n",
       " 'People like it. ',\n",
       " 'You too can join in the manner you deem fit.   My dear countrymen, the government schemes will continue exist and run, but it is necessary that these schemes always remain operational. ',\n",

       " 'In our country, we give subsidy for the gas cylinders. ',\n",
       " 'Crores of rupees were spent on it but we did not know if it reached the right people or not. ',\n",
       " 'If this subsidy reached people on time or not? The Government has made some changes in the scheme. ',\n",
       " 'The government undertook the largest ‘Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme’ to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of ‘Jan Dhan Account’ or ‘Aadhar Card’ etc. ',\n",
       " 'I am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in Guinness Book of World Records as the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme which has been implemented successfully.',\n",

       " 'Thirdly the state and Indian government compiled the lists of beneficiaries. ',\n",
       " 'That was connected to account and Aadhar. ',\n",
       " 'This work is still in progress. ',\n",
       " 'Nowadays, even the MNREGA scheme, which provides employment opportunities in villages, is being connected to it. ',\n",
       " 'There were lots of complaints about this scheme. ',\n",
       " 'In many places the wages of the labourers is now being directly transferred into their accounts. ',\n",
       " 'There were complaints about student scholarships too, they too are being transferred into their accounts. ',\n",
       " 'This has been started and will be gradually taken forward. ',\n",
       " 'Till now around 40,000 crore rupees are directly reaching the beneficiaries through various schemes. ',\n",
       " 'According to my rough estimate, around 35-40 schemes are now under ‘Direct Benefit Transfer.’   My dear countrymen, 26th January is the golden moment in the life of Indian democracy. ',\n",

       " 'All the parties and all the members deliberated on the sanctity of the constitution, its importance to understand the true interpretation of the constitution. ',\n",
       " 'It was an excellent discussion. ',\n",
       " 'We should take this thing forward.',\n",
       " ' Can Republic Day be an opportunity to connect the masses with the system? Our constitution grants us several rights and there are many discussions on it and it should be so and it is equally important. ',\n",
       " 'But constitution equally emphasizes on duty also. ',\n",
       " 'But it is seen that duties are hardly discussed. ',\n",
       " 'At the most, whenever there are elections, then we see advertisement all around us, they write on the walls and hoardings are put to tell that to vote is our sacred duty. ',\n",
       " 'There is a lot of talk about duties during elections, but why not discuss our duties in general life too. ',\n",
       " 'This year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar then can we make 26th January a medium to organize debates, poetry, slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools, colleges, villages, cities and various organizations and societies. ',\n",
       " 'If 125 crore Indians take dutiful steps one after the other, they can make history. ',\n",
       " 'But at least let’s start with discussions. ',\n",
       " 'I have An iidea – Send me an essay or poem before 26th January about duty in Hindi or English or your native language. ',\n",

       " 'On 26th January we celebrate Republic Day. ',\n",
       " 'Can we citizens and school and college students take up the initiative of cleaning the statue of any great men installed in our city, of cleaning the premises, we can do best of cleanliness and best of decoration on the occasion of 26th January. ',\n",
       " 'And I am not saying this on government lines. ',\n",
       " 'We become so emotional about getting the statues of great men erected but become equally complacent when it comes to maintaining them. ',\n",

       " 'But this should be done by the citizens willfully. ',\n",
