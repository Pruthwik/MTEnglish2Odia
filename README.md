# MTEnglish2Odia
## Machine Translation from English to Odia language
This is a healthy start to building Automated machine translation for `English` to `Odia` language.
This has been built mainly to help increase quality odia wikipedia articles by translating for English Wikipedia.
The approach is to start building a parallel corpus between English and Odia language which can later be used in SMT(Statistical Machine Translation) or NMT (Neural Machine Translation) in future by interested people.

## Current status
- Parallel corpus of more than 11706 English-Odia words/sentences corpus prepared by parsing the Wikipedia translation dump data.

## Future Road map
- Utilizing Wikidata for more word corpus
- Using Transliteration between `Hindi` and `Odia` language to prepare corpus for unknown words/phrases.
- Around *July 2019* it has been planned to prepare the first release of English-Odia translation API for Public for free
- The details on the plan and progress will be updated.
- Any types of contribution to build the corpus and later on SMT or NMT approach is always welcome.
