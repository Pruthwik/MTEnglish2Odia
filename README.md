## Machine Translation from English to Odia language
This is a healthy start to building Automated machine translation for `English` to `Odia` language.
This has been built mainly to help increase quality odia wikipedia articles by translating for English Wikipedia.
The approach is to start building a parallel corpus between English and Odia language which can later be used in SMT(Statistical Machine Translation) or NMT (Neural Machine Translation) in future by interested people.
