Machine translation from [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) to [Odia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odia_language) language

## Analysis so far:
[Machine Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation) (MT) has started as early as on 1950s. Based on the progress on this field, the MT can be broadly categorized into following types:
- Rule based MT (RBMT)
- Statistical MT (SMT) and 
- Neural MT (NMT)
- Hybrid MT (HMT)

The NMT is giving best score (BLEU score) followed by SMT and RBMT. As explained in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1708/1708.04559.pdf) for Indic languages SMT is performing better (at least 10% higher) than RBMT.
Based on the reading and analysis from some existing papers, as the corpus is low, for the time-being we will go ahead with SMT ([Statistical Machine Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_machine_translation)) first. As the corpus grows, we will start testing our luck in NMT ([Neural Machine Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_machine_translation))


## High level Roadmap

This road map is prepared based on my extra time and availability to work. If I will get more help we can deliver early.

### <a name="december2018"></a> Detailed works completed in December 2018
- Found corpus worth around [27,000 English-Odia tab separated translation pairs](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2879)
 This needs work on the followings:
  - Some preprocessing need to be done.
  - All translation not so accurate based on few manual review
  - Spelling mistakes are there
- After reading [one article](http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?pid=S1405-55462017000400725&script=sci_arttext) on preprocessing English-Hindi corpus for SMT, I got insight on the following preprocessing tasks need to be done at first:
  - Punctuation should NOT be removed
  - **English** text should be lower cased as Odia does not have any upper case or lower case
  - Spell normalization (Which is like [Lemmatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatization)) will have a greater impact
  - The impact of mapping numbers with unique class labels is not very effective and can be left out.
  - We need [NER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) (Named Entity Recognition) words for which [Transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration) is enough
  - We need POS tag data to improve the accuracy also.
- [Moses](http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.Overview) MT tool is open source and ideal for developing SMT for our purpose. 
  - It needs parallel corpus to train and build the model after that prediction it can do.
  - Data curation as explained on above point will be crucial to train this kind of system.
  - If no better option available, we will mostly go with this approach.
- Other than this I got a good sense to keep an eye on [Hybrid Machine Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_machine_translation), which will be mixture of RBMT and SMT.
- There is not enough corpus available to go for NMT/SMT currently. We need to prepare a platform like [Google translate community](https://translate.google.com/community?source=mfooter#en/or) where we can manually create English-Odia phrase or word pairs. For this the following needed:
  - UI hosted somewhere on cloud which can handle at least 100 requests per minute
  - A DB, also hosted in cloud to store the data provided by users
  - Possible suggestions for new users to start translating
  - Review mechanism on the translated terms, even with good intention grammatical or syntactical errors need to be validated
  - This infrastructure need to be hosted somewhere on cloud and it should be absolutely free to use.
- **Unknown words handling** : There will be definitely terms will come for which Odia words will not be present. These are some suggestions to handle unknown words:
  - Transliterate those words to Odia
  - Using some other existing translation system, convert those words to Hindi/Sanskrit then transliterate those words to Odia. Because most of the words in between Hindi/Sanskrit and Odia are same and people can understand.

## Impediments
- [x] Get at least 10,000 parallel open corpus for Odia language to begin with.
- [ ] Verification of the existing corpus badly needed.
- [ ] Moses does not run on Windows. Need an Ubuntu OS to test that.
- [ ] Need a cloud system to host manual translation API server and in future for online translation.

*"In my dream of the 21st century for the State, I would have young men and women who put the interest of the State before them. They will have pride in themselves, confidence in themselves. They will not be at anybodyâ€™s mercy, except their own selves. By their brains, intelligence and capacity, they will recapture the history of Kalinga." - [Biju Pattnaik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biju_Patnaik)*
